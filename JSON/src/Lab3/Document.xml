    <paragraph id="first">
        He if free who lives as he wishes to live; who is neither subject to compulsion nor
        to hindrance, nor to force;whose movements to action are not impeded, whose desires attain their purpose, and who does not fall into that which he would avoid.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
        Do we then find any of the bad tree from sorrow, free from
        fear, who does not fall into that which he would avoid, and does not obtain that which he wishes? Not one; nor then do we find any bad man free.
