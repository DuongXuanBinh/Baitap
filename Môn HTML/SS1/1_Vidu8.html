    <p>The Internet is a network of networks. That is, computer networks are linked to other networks,
        spanning countries and today the globe. The TCP/IP transfer protocol provides the bindings
        that connect all these computers the world over.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Hyper Text Markup Language is the standard language that the Web uses for creating and
        recognizing documents. Although not a subset of, it is loosely related to the Standard Generalized
        Markup Language (SGML). SGML is a method for representing document formatting languages.</p>
    <a id="Consistency">Unity and Variety</a>
    <br>
    <p>A basic rule is that of unity and variety. That is, everything should fit together as a unit,
        but at the same time there is enough variety to keep things interesting. Consistency creates and
        reinforces the unique identity of a site. Colors, fonts, column layout and other design elements
        should be consistent throughout every section of the site.</p>
